// Constants
/*
	We need to find some sort of common scalar to translate each point of BT damage
	into the Doom equivalent. 
	
	It makes the most sense to use KE = 1/2m*v^2 here to calculate the kinetic energy.
	
	SSG -> 20 pellets, at 4.8g each for 96g total.
	Fired at 365m/s
	Kinetic Force is => ~6400J
	Deals on average: ~200 dmg

	AC/20 -> 5 shots per ton, gives ~181kg per round.
	Fired at 305m/s
	Kinetic Force is => ~8,420,000J (Holy Shit!)
	Deals: 20 dmg
	
	Doing some simple math => 8,420,000J / 6400J we find that the AC20 exerts
	around ~1300x the force of the SSG!

	We'll now divide this multiplier by 20 to find a scalar for the damage per BT 
	dmg point: 1300 / 20 = 65
	
	Damage scalar is: 65x with mechs at full-size.
	
	[Taking a picture of the atlas and cyberdemon side-by-side]
	Atlas = 344pixels
	Cyberdemon = 430 pixels
	
	The cyberdemon's scale hasn't been touched here so we'll use that as a template.
	We know the cyberdemon is 12ft tall, thus we find: 430 / 12ft = ~35.8 pixels a foot.
	When applied to the atlas we get: (344 / 35.8) = 9.6ft. 
	
	Now we'll divide by the cannonical height of the atlas, being 54ft to get a 
	scalar of ~5.6x smaller than normal.

	This also means out projectiles will be 5.6x smaller than normal.
	Now, our initial mass for the AC20 was 181kg, scaling it back 5.6x we must apply OldMass * s^3 = NewMass, 
	where S is our scalar. Because we're going backwards we'll take the recipricol of 5.6, or ~0.18, giving us a new
	mass of : ~1kg. We'll leave speed alone because our coordinate system takes care of that.

	Finally, using the Kinetic Energy forumla we get:
	1/2(1 * 305^2) = 46,512J 

	Dividing by 20 gives us 2,326J per dmg point.
	Now, our AC20 is exerting 2.75x the joules of an SSG.

	So, if we assume damage scales linearly then we should be dealing 2.75 * 200 = 550 dmg.
	If we divide by 20 we get 27.5x the normal damage, but we'll round up to 28x.
	BT Scalar :> 28x.

	How was this constant found?
	First, a Hellbringer is placed in a map then a pillar
	is placed next to it, the pillar is then risen until it matches
	the Hellbringer's observed height.
	
	This number is derrived like so
	HellBringer = 12.9m, ~70 units.
	
	12.9m / 70.0u = ~0.18 meters a unit.
